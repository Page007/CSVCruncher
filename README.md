# CSVCruncher
This project, essentially created in c++ has a file class that can be used  as a file cruncher and can parse, (at present) less complex files like .csv and .txt files.
We can try to parse .pdf documents into this software, which would be helpful.
Now, this project contains the functionality of integrating the .csv file into objects of a specific Studeny class upon which, preliminary algorithms may be run.
GOALS : 
1. Sorting the student entries according to the cumulative marks.
2. Finding ranks of a particular query(Either name or branch)
Any other goals are welcome.
Result Compilation into a PDF file may help us, so that the result can be printed with help of pdf format itself.
